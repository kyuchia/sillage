"""
Shared query + trip-assembly logic for Sillage.

Both `export/export_trips.py` (CLI) and `api/main.py` (HTTP) call into here, so the
JSON they produce is identical by construction rather than by careful copying.

The public entry points are:

    build_trips(conn, layers, ...)               -> dict   (the exact trips.json shape)
    build_trips_with_summary(conn, layers, ...)  -> (dict, summary)
    get_range(conn)                              -> dict   (what data actually exists)

`build_trips` returns the documented JSON shape and nothing else — no counters, no
debug keys — because it is serialised straight to the client. The CLI needs per-layer
counts for its console report, so it calls the `_with_summary` variant instead; the
summary is a side channel, deliberately kept out of the payload.

Output shape (see the restart brief, "Data Format: data/trips.json"):
